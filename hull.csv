Dr Konstantinos Mantis,https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/konstantinos-mantis,"

Research interests
As a clinical and exercise psychologist, Dr Mantis is interested in three areas: 
 
a) Mental health and physical activity 
b) Physical activity and health promotion 
c) Psychological assessment 
 
Specifically, research has shown that physical activity (PA) has various benefits on people’s mental and physical health. So, Dr Mantis is more interested in how PA helps athletes and non-athletes cope with issues such as depression, anxiety, and so on. 
 
Dr Mantis is also interested in finding optimal ways of motivating individuals to engage in desired health behaviours (e.g., PA). For instance, how we frame PA and health messages (e.g., emphasis on gains or losses, etc.), how we deliver such messages (e.g., using images, music, etc.), and how we customise messages to individuals’ characteristics (e.g., providing tailored feedback to individuals depending on their personality traits) can moderate the magnitude of their motivation.  
 
By identifying optimal ways of promoting health behaviours, we can help individuals adopt a healthier lifestyle (e.g., convincing sedentary people to be more active), follow recommended plans (e.g., helping injured athletes adhere to a rehab program), and so on. 
 
Finally, assessing psychological variables (e.g., personality) that can influence individual responses to behavior change interventions is another area of his research interests. For example, what tests of personality assess specific traits of individuals more accurately and how these traits relate to specific lifestyles? 
 
Dr Mantis is happy to supervise any projects that belong to the above research areas.

",Faculty of Health Sciences
Dr Justin Sturge,https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/justin-sturge,"

Research interests
Dr Sturge's research since 2001 has mainly focused on understanding how the receptor Endo180 contributes to the different stages of cancer. He is now using the latest technologies available to translate this knowledge into better survival rates for patients. His research in this area began by investigating the basic cell biology of Endo180 function as a pro-migratory receptor, followed by its function in more complex in vitro models of human cancer and most recently the translation of the findings towards diagnostic advances for breast, prostate, pancreatic and other cancer patients. In particular the discovery that Endo180 behaves as a supressor-to-promoter switch for the invasive behaviour of normal prostate epithelial cells set a precedent for this translational research. This includes development of the first diagnostic test for the accurate measurement of Endo180 levels in patient serum and the first multi-modal bio-imaging probe to monitor the pro-invasive switch in Endo180 in patients using near infra red (NIR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We are now conducting clinical trials to determine the value of Endo180 as a predictive cancer biomarker.

Dr Colin Veach,https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/colin-veach,"

Research interests
Dr Veach's research investigates the articulation of power and dominion in medieval Britain and Ireland, placed in the context of Europe. His 2014 monograph Lordship in Four Realms was one of the first truly transnational studies of the medieval aristocracy, the social and cultural glue which bound the Britain and Ireland to continental Europe. Utilising the lens of ‘lordship’, it looked at how one family adapted its strategies of domination in four distinct polities: England, Ireland, Wales and Normandy.  
Recently, he has begun to approach transnational history and political culture from the perspective of empire, particularly through involvement in collaborative projects funded by the Leverhulme Trust (‘New Interpretations on the Angevin World’), and the AHRC (‘An Empire of Islands’).  
The two strands of ‘lordship’ and ‘empire’ are brought together and developed in his current Leverhulme-funded project ‘England’s First Colony: State-Building on the Irish Frontier, 1199-1265’

Research interests
I am an environmental geochemist,  who enjoys wide collaboration and likes to work with new methods and in new contexts. I currently work with colleagues on projects as diverse as the world’s oldest phytolith and plastic diagenesis, However, three themes determine where I am currently focussing my efforts. 
 
1)	I have an established speleothem-based research programme investigating palaeoclimate in central northern Africa, which has received funding from NERC (NE/J014133/1) and the Leverhulme Trust (IN-2012-113) in the past. The project also uses loess and numerical approaches to fill a critical gap in our constraint of climate change in a particularly sensitive region. This is part of a big partnership, with colleagues at Hull (Bird, Bellerby), Gottingen, Innsbruck, Salzburg, SISKA, Gabes, ONM, Sfax, Liverpool BGS and Reading.  
2)	An emerging key focus  for me is continental carbonate “Geo-system services” for carbon budgeting / management in karst and alkaline igneous regions, and associated with hypoeralkaline residues.  This develops from an intersection between previous projects funded by NERC (NE/L014211/1) and BP (UPSCALE project), and is associated with the new BCRA-funded National Cave Monitoring Centre. Again, I enjoy collaboration with a wide range of partners in this work including, the BCRA, the Woodland Trust and Aberdeen University.    
3)	My most established area of research is in quantitative paleoceanography of strong bottom circulation. Currently, this is dominated by IMMAGE (Investigating Miocene Mediterranean-Atlantic Gateway Exchange), an amphibious IODP – ICDP proposal. This major initiative is led by  Bristol, and involves a wide range of international collaborators. I am also involved with research showing competition of NADW and AAIW during the last deglacial on the Uruguay margin, and revealing Heinrich-event-sized iceberg pulses in the mid-latitude Pacific Ocean.

In particular, intercellular communication in between antigen presenting cells and T cells in humans shapes up the fate of T cells and this can affect the way we respond to pathogens and allergens, potentially making different individuals more or less susceptible to disease. Molecular pathways of intercellular communication between immune cells relevant in infection, critical inflammatory conditions and cancer are currently under investigation.

I'm interested in the behavioural and genomic adaptations of animals (primarily freshwater fishes). Primarily this is because these adaptations can lead to the formation of new species, and understanding how species evolve is of fundamental importance to biodiversity and conservation. I use haplochromine cichlid fishes to study this. I'm also interested in the role that anthropogenic pressures can exert which may lead to evolutionary change in populations over time, and this includes research on Atlantic salmon.

We’re looking to recruit three PhD students to join our “Happy Chemical Cluster” and work with us on Animal Behaviour and/or Molecular Biology.  
 
There is a possible role for serotonin in the sand-castle building behaviour of cichlid fishes, behaviour carried out by males to attract females. We seek to experimentally test how inhibiting the serotonin pathway with drugs could impact the skill of males, and the mating preference of the females. As well as showing how pollution could affect mating behaviour under different climate change scenarios, this could also demonstrate a mechanism by which the serotonin pathway generates reproductive isolation and leads to the formation of new species, a completely novel mechanism for generating biodiversity. 
 
The primary focus of one of the PhD projects is cichlid fish behaviour, but there is the possibility to develop the project according to your interests, and to include molecular genetics, CRISPR/cas9 gene editing, and bioinformatics. We are looking for a student who can demonstrate academic excellence in Biology (or similar degree), including animal behaviour, and experimental design and analysis.

How Do People Handle Falsehood? 
 
A daily challenge for the mental system is to distinguish between true and false information. The rise of “fake news” seems to make it more and more difficult to distinguish between truth and falsehood. Mounting evidence demonstrates that false information alters existing knowledge even when people are warned about falsehood or surprisingly, even when they know the truth. Thus, it is crucial to investigate how the mental system deals with false information to explain and prevent errors in validation.

Professor Andrew Heyes,https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/andrew-heyes,"

Research interests
My PhD concerned the development of laser based flow measurement techniques that can be used to determine the velocity field in supersonic flows – over an aircraft wing for example. Ever since, the development and application of flow diagnostics for extreme environments has remained a strand of my research activity. In particular I have developed techniques for surface and flow temperature measurement using the spectral and temporal luminescent properties of ceramic, so-called, thermographic phosphors. This work has generated to a number of patents and the creation of a spin-out company, now called Sensor Coating Systems ltd, (www.sensorcoatings.com) which can trace its origins to 2002. SCS offers bespoke measurement services to a wide range of industries and has offices and laboratories in East London.   
Another strand of my research concerns energy based industrial symbiosis. To this day the UK, and especially the Humber region, has numerous energy intensive industries and the energy content in the waste heat they reject to the atmosphere far exceeds the nation’s current or foreseeable renewable energy generating capacity. Finding economic and technical means to recovery and reuse this energy could make a substantial contribution both to the economy and our aspirations for a sustainable carbon neutral future. My work concerns identifying potential relationships between companies to form optimised symbiotic energy networks where the waste from one becomes an input to another. This work has been funded by the EU under Horizon 2020 and is encapsulated as part of the SHAREBOX (http://sharebox-project.eu) tool set.

I am particularly interested in the production of different knowledges associated with farming and rural living, in the implications of technological interventions in agriculture, in human-nonhuman relationships in rural spaces, and in 'alternative' ways of living in the countryside and of producing and distributing food. 
 
I am currently a Co-Principal Investigator on the Wellcome-Trust funded FIELD (Farm-level Interdisciplinary Approaches to Endemic Livestock Disease) project. FIELD is run by a group of researchers from six UK universities, all interested in the challenges posed to livestock health, welfare and productivity by endemic diseases. The project focuses on Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) and lameness as two contrasting examples of endemic diseases. Endemic diseases are common but difficult to eradicate, and they have an impact on animal health and productivity. We will consider how responses to these diseases have changed over time, and what their impacts are for animals and farm businesses. We will ask if they can be better managed, and if so how. We want to identify ‘best bet’ interventions to help reduce the incidence of these disease and their costs to UK farming. The research includes investigating the history of these diseases to see what we can learn from the past. It involves working with present day farmers and vets, to find out what problems these diseases cause on farms and how farmers and vets deal with those problems: we want to consider different approaches taken by different farmers and vets on specific farms. The project also involves creating economic and epidemiological models which aim to identify how transmissible diseases like BVD move between animals and farms, helping us to identify areas of risk in farming systems. Our project website is available at https://field-wt.co.uk/

Dr John Elliott,https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/john-elliott,"

Research interests
My research interest lies in the general area of fluid mechanics. Although this covers a very wide range of research activity, my main expertise lies in high Reynolds number viscous flows. 
 
My initial investigations focused on the phenomena of boundary layer separation, both for steady-state and unsteady flows. I have also been interested in the stability of shear layers and boundary-layer flows, with particular emphasis on Tollmien-Schlichting, Gortler, and Kelvin-Helmholtz waves. This also led to an interest in sound generation. 
 
I am also interested in Stefan-like problems involving heat and mass transfer, such the impact  of freezing/boiling water droplets on aerofoils. This emanates from my PhD thesis (under Eric Watson) an investigation into the melting of ice-shapes.

Dr Sandra Jones,https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/sandra-jones,"

Research interests
My research revolves around changes in whole heart and cellular function with increasing age, from the perspectives of normal physiology and pathophysiology. My particular area of study are the changes in ionic regulation with age leading to the predisposition to arrhythmias, and other disorders of excitation and contraction within the elderly heart. Primarily my research group have used proteomics to examine the associated changes in protein expression and regulatory systems responsible for producing the age-associated changes in phenotype, coupled with functional measurements using electrophysiology. Recent targeted proteins in the mammalian heart have been the gap junctional subunit connexin43, the differing isoforms of the voltage-gated sodium ion channels and voltage-gated calcium ion channels. Our studies have conclude the change in expression of these ion channels expressed in the age heart, leave the age heart in a state of imbalance and experience high frequency of arrhythmias. Furthermore, we are now using interventions to protect the heart as it ages from the onset of associated pathologies, ranging from the global (e.g. exercise interventions), to the specific pharmaceutical agents (e.g. directed manipulation of signaling pathways), leading a novel approach to reduce AF events, to ultimately become a therapeutic strategy to prevent and treat AF in the elderly who are often unfit for surgery.


Postgraduate supervision
Dr Jones welcomes applicants with experience in mammalian physiology (at degree level) and specific knowledge of the heart. Applicants should understand how ion channels contribute and give rise to the normal action potential of the mammalian heart at a basic degree level, as her research focuses on cardiac dysfunction and how it arises (for example with ageing). The techniques used in the laboratory are proteomic, genomic and functional. At the time of appointment, specific projects will be offered in line with ongoing projects in the group.

My thesis identified how social influences impact women’s birth choices, together with how midwives affect their decision-making in the context of their care. Women’s voices tell their stories of personal insights relating to the decisions they craft. This study explores whether emancipation reduces pressure to conform to authority and consequently what the implications might mean in a wider sociological context of birth experience.  
In November 2017 I was awarded my first grant by East Riding of Yorkshire Clinical Commissioning Group. This research will explore the preferences of women who are eligible to book to the Fatima Allam Birth Centre and to determine the knowledge, preferences, views and experiences of the concept of midwifery-led care within Hull and East Yorkshire NHS Trust.

Dr Stewart Mottram,https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/stewart-mottram,"

Research interests
Stewart Mottram is an interdisciplinary researcher specialising in seventeenth-century literature and culture in relation to topics surrounding literature and religion and literature and environment. Mottram draws on the research methods and approaches of History and Heritage Studies, and works in partnership with colleagues in Human Geography and Environmental Science.  
 
Literature and Religion 
Mottram’s latest book, ‘Ruin and Reformation in Spenser, Shakespeare, and Marvell' (Oxford University Press, 2019), is the first major study to explore the impact of reformation violence and ruin creation on English literature spanning the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It reads early modern English literature in light of English reformation history, and in dialogue with recent historiographical perspectives, exploring writerly responses to the religious violence of the long reformation in England and Wales across over a century of literature and history, from the establishment of the national church under Henry VIII (1534), to its disestablishment under Oliver Cromwell (1653). It focuses on representations of ruined churches, monasteries, and cathedrals in the works of a range of English Protestant writers, including Spenser, Shakespeare, Jonson, Herbert, Denham, and Marvell, reading literature alongside episodes in English reformation history: from the dissolution of the monasteries and the destruction of church icons and images, to the puritan reforms of the 1640s.  
 
Ruin and Reformation has been reviewed in 'The Review of English Studies', 'The Seventeenth Century', 'The Spenser Review', and 'Journal of British Studies'. Andrew Hui writes in 'The Spenser Review' that ""There are few literary critics today who have his deep reservoir of knowledge in the literary, political and religious history of the period. An empiricist at heart, his command of primary texts in manuscript and print is masterful and knowledge of secondary scholarship impressive."" 
 
Literature and Environment 
Mottram’s latest book project combines Literature, History, and Human Geography methodologies to explore the challenges and opportunities of living with water in the early modern Atlantic world, asking how cultural, social and technological responses to issues like flooding, water sanitation and supply, and water and wellbeing find representation in English and North American literature from this period.  
 
Mottram currently leads an AHRC/XR Stories Creative Industries Cluster project, ‘By the rising tide of Humber: Flooding Andrew Marvell’s Hull in VR’, an interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers in English, Geography, and the Energy and Environment Institute (EEI) at Hull together with industry partners, BetaJester Ltd. The project recreates in virtual reality (VR) a geographically and historically accurate model of 1640s Hull, which we use to test Hull's flood defence capability in the 1640s by subjecting the virtual town to an historical weather event - a documented storm surge and flood in 1646 - using flood modelling tools developed in the EEI. Through knowledge exchange, the project is driving developments in heritage and environmental applications of VR, while at the same time the VR product is enabling us to bring historical floods to life.


Postgraduate supervision
Dr Mottram welcomes applications from PhD students in the following broad areas: 
 
- Literature and religion: 1400-1700

SUMMARY 
 
Mike's focus is (i) flood basalt volcanism and its environmental effects; (ii) tropical weathering and lateritization processes. He uses a variety of analytical techniques - geochemistry (XRF, ICP and isotope studies), geochronology (Ar/Ar and Palaeomag). Fieldwork investigations are worldwide: in detail the evolution of the Deccan Traps large igneous province (LIP), and LIPs elsewhere (i.e., CRBP, BTIP, Iceland, Hawaii, Emeishan, Kalkarindji, Shatsky Rise). He is collaborating with Chinese scientists on projects documenting the development of the Himalaya and the associated floral evolution. His weathering studies have documented the fate of elements and behaviour of isotope systems during extreme alteration.


Postgraduate supervision
Mike is an established research supervisor (10 PhD students and c. 10 MSc, MRes students since 2000). These projects have resulted in >50 joint authored peer-reviewed publications. Enquiries and applications are welcomed in the following research areas: 
 
1) All areas of volcanology, in particular those related to the study of large igneous provinces, and associate environmental and/or biotic change. 
2) Geochemical and isotopic studies of deep weathering, in particular linkages between their development to environmental change  
 
 
Themes for past, present and future PhD studies include: 
 
Volcanology: 
Flood basalt volcanism 
Environmental effects of volcanic eruptions 
Interrogating the sedimentary record for LIP events 
Chemical memory of LIP eruptions 
Ancient Icelandic eruptions 
 
Deep weathering processes: 
Laterites and lateritization processes 
Behaviour of isotopic systems during deep weathering 
Evaluating weathering profiles as a paleoenvironmental proxy environment

What problems for people do wild animals bring, and how can we best manage them? What problems for wildlife do people bring, and how best can we manage them? How can we reconcile competing objectives for wildlife across fragmented, multi-owner landscapes? What measurements of wildlife do we need to take in order to make evidence-based decisions about their management, how good are our estimates and how good do they need to be? These are the sorts of multi-disciplinary questions that keep me awake. If you would like to research solutions to peoples’ problems associated with wildlife (especially deer, but also other vertebrates) for the benefit of people and wildlife, I’d welcome a chat.

- Economics of innovation, systems of innovation, evolutionary processes and ST&I policy; 
- Geography of innovation, innovation and knowledge ecosystems, and agglomeration studies; 
- Regional and macro-level determinants of entrepreneurship, institutions and network externalities;
