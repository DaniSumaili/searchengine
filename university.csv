46,Professor Andrew Heyes,https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/andrew-heyes,"

Research interests
My PhD concerned the development of laser based flow measurement techniques that can be used to determine the velocity field in supersonic flows – over an aircraft wing for example. Ever since, the development and application of flow diagnostics for extreme environments has remained a strand of my research activity. In particular I have developed techniques for surface and flow temperature measurement using the spectral and temporal luminescent properties of ceramic, so-called, thermographic phosphors. This work has generated to a number of patents and the creation of a spin-out company, now called Sensor Coating Systems ltd, (www.sensorcoatings.com) which can trace its origins to 2002. SCS offers bespoke measurement services to a wide range of industries and has offices and laboratories in East London.   
Another strand of my research concerns energy based industrial symbiosis. To this day the UK, and especially the Humber region, has numerous energy intensive industries and the energy content in the waste heat they reject to the atmosphere far exceeds the nation’s current or foreseeable renewable energy generating capacity. Finding economic and technical means to recovery and reuse this energy could make a substantial contribution both to the economy and our aspirations for a sustainable carbon neutral future. My work concerns identifying potential relationships between companies to form optimised symbiotic energy networks where the waste from one becomes an input to another. This work has been funded by the EU under Horizon 2020 and is encapsulated as part of the SHAREBOX (http://sharebox-project.eu) tool set.

With an interdisciplinary background incorporating economics, entrepreneurship, industrial engineering, ST&I policy and intellectual capital management, Dr. Khavandkar`s research spans economics of innovation, entrepreneurship, network externalities, knowledge & innovation ecosystem and agglomeration studies. A unifying theme across his work is an interest in “co-creation and co-evolution” as an avenue to engage individuals, firms, institutions and communities in sustainable, intersectoral and collaborative innovation practices in the short and long term. He is currently involved in a research project (United Kingdom Science and Technology Parks Survey - UKSTP Survey) that seeks to better understand the dynamics of co-creation and co-evolution in the UK science and technology parks, and how spatial proximity shapes the onsite firms` cognitive structure and perceptions of organisational, social and technological proximities, and what these mean for innovation and knowledge ecosystem design in Britain. His areas of research include: 
 
- Economics of innovation, systems of innovation, evolutionary processes and ST&I policy; 
- Geography of innovation, innovation and knowledge ecosystems, and agglomeration studies; 
- Regional and macro-level determinants of entrepreneurship, institutions and network externalities; 
- Co-creation models, open innovation, innovation intermediaries [particularly, in/and for micro and small firms];

My thesis identified how social influences impact women’s birth choices, together with how midwives affect their decision-making in the context of their care. Women’s voices tell their stories of personal insights relating to the decisions they craft. This study explores whether emancipation reduces pressure to conform to authority and consequently what the implications might mean in a wider sociological context of birth experience.  
In November 2017 I was awarded my first grant by East Riding of Yorkshire Clinical Commissioning Group. This research will explore the preferences of women who are eligible to book to the Fatima Allam Birth Centre and to determine the knowledge, preferences, views and experiences of the concept of midwifery-led care within Hull and East Yorkshire NHS Trust.

Research interests
I'm interested in the behavioural and genomic adaptations of animals (primarily freshwater fishes). Primarily this is because these adaptations can lead to the formation of new species, and understanding how species evolve is of fundamental importance to biodiversity and conservation. I use haplochromine cichlid fishes to study this. I'm also interested in the role that anthropogenic pressures can exert which may lead to evolutionary change in populations over time, and this includes research on Atlantic salmon.

We’re looking to recruit three PhD students to join our “Happy Chemical Cluster” and work with us on Animal Behaviour and/or Molecular Biology.  
 
There is a possible role for serotonin in the sand-castle building behaviour of cichlid fishes, behaviour carried out by males to attract females. We seek to experimentally test how inhibiting the serotonin pathway with drugs could impact the skill of males, and the mating preference of the females. As well as showing how pollution could affect mating behaviour under different climate change scenarios, this could also demonstrate a mechanism by which the serotonin pathway generates reproductive isolation and leads to the formation of new species, a completely novel mechanism for generating biodiversity. 
 
The primary focus of one of the PhD projects is cichlid fish behaviour, but there is the possibility to develop the project according to your interests, and to include molecular genetics, CRISPR/cas9 gene editing, and bioinformatics. We are looking for a student who can demonstrate academic excellence in Biology (or similar degree), including animal behaviour, and experimental design and analysis.

Research interests
My research revolves around changes in whole heart and cellular function with increasing age, from the perspectives of normal physiology and pathophysiology. My particular area of study are the changes in ionic regulation with age leading to the predisposition to arrhythmias, and other disorders of excitation and contraction within the elderly heart. Primarily my research group have used proteomics to examine the associated changes in protein expression and regulatory systems responsible for producing the age-associated changes in phenotype, coupled with functional measurements using electrophysiology. Recent targeted proteins in the mammalian heart have been the gap junctional subunit connexin43, the differing isoforms of the voltage-gated sodium ion channels and voltage-gated calcium ion channels. Our studies have conclude the change in expression of these ion channels expressed in the age heart, leave the age heart in a state of imbalance and experience high frequency of arrhythmias. Furthermore, we are now using interventions to protect the heart as it ages from the onset of associated pathologies, ranging from the global (e.g. exercise interventions), to the specific pharmaceutical agents (e.g. directed manipulation of signaling pathways), leading a novel approach to reduce AF events, to ultimately become a therapeutic strategy to prevent and treat AF in the elderly who are often unfit for surgery.


Postgraduate supervision
Dr Jones welcomes applicants with experience in mammalian physiology (at degree level) and specific knowledge of the heart. Applicants should understand how ion channels contribute and give rise to the normal action potential of the mammalian heart at a basic degree level, as her research focuses on cardiac dysfunction and how it arises (for example with ageing). The techniques used in the laboratory are proteomic, genomic and functional. At the time of appointment, specific projects will be offered in line with ongoing projects in the group.

The transformation of monarchical culture in the “late early modern period” is at the centre of my work, but I am also conducting research on the transition from monarchy to republic in Germany after 1918. 
 
Secondly, I am interested in the relationship of European expansion and natural sciences in the age of the Enlightenment.

Research interests
I am an environmental geochemist,  who enjoys wide collaboration and likes to work with new methods and in new contexts. I currently work with colleagues on projects as diverse as the world’s oldest phytolith and plastic diagenesis, However, three themes determine where I am currently focussing my efforts. 
 
1)	I have an established speleothem-based research programme investigating palaeoclimate in central northern Africa, which has received funding from NERC (NE/J014133/1) and the Leverhulme Trust (IN-2012-113) in the past. The project also uses loess and numerical approaches to fill a critical gap in our constraint of climate change in a particularly sensitive region. This is part of a big partnership, with colleagues at Hull (Bird, Bellerby), Gottingen, Innsbruck, Salzburg, SISKA, Gabes, ONM, Sfax, Liverpool BGS and Reading.  
2)	An emerging key focus  for me is continental carbonate “Geo-system services” for carbon budgeting / management in karst and alkaline igneous regions, and associated with hypoeralkaline residues.  This develops from an intersection between previous projects funded by NERC (NE/L014211/1) and BP (UPSCALE project), and is associated with the new BCRA-funded National Cave Monitoring Centre. Again, I enjoy collaboration with a wide range of partners in this work including, the BCRA, the Woodland Trust and Aberdeen University.    
3)	My most established area of research is in quantitative paleoceanography of strong bottom circulation. Currently, this is dominated by IMMAGE (Investigating Miocene Mediterranean-Atlantic Gateway Exchange), an amphibious IODP – ICDP proposal. This major initiative is led by  Bristol, and involves a wide range of international collaborators. I am also involved with research showing competition of NADW and AAIW during the last deglacial on the Uruguay margin, and revealing Heinrich-event-sized iceberg pulses in the mid-latitude Pacific Ocean.

Research interests
My research and teaching focuses on issues surrounding food, farming and the countryside. 
 
I am particularly interested in the production of different knowledges associated with farming and rural living, in the implications of technological interventions in agriculture, in human-nonhuman relationships in rural spaces, and in 'alternative' ways of living in the countryside and of producing and distributing food. 
 
I am currently a Co-Principal Investigator on the Wellcome-Trust funded FIELD (Farm-level Interdisciplinary Approaches to Endemic Livestock Disease) project. FIELD is run by a group of researchers from six UK universities, all interested in the challenges posed to livestock health, welfare and productivity by endemic diseases. The project focuses on Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) and lameness as two contrasting examples of endemic diseases. Endemic diseases are common but difficult to eradicate, and they have an impact on animal health and productivity. We will consider how responses to these diseases have changed over time, and what their impacts are for animals and farm businesses. We will ask if they can be better managed, and if so how. We want to identify ‘best bet’ interventions to help reduce the incidence of these disease and their costs to UK farming. The research includes investigating the history of these diseases to see what we can learn from the past. It involves working with present day farmers and vets, to find out what problems these diseases cause on farms and how farmers and vets deal with those problems: we want to consider different approaches taken by different farmers and vets on specific farms. The project also involves creating economic and epidemiological models which aim to identify how transmissible diseases like BVD move between animals and farms, helping us to identify areas of risk in farming systems. Our project website is available at https://field-wt.co.uk/

Research interests
As a clinical and exercise psychologist, Dr Mantis is interested in three areas: 
 
a) Mental health and physical activity 
b) Physical activity and health promotion 
c) Psychological assessment 
 
Specifically, research has shown that physical activity (PA) has various benefits on people’s mental and physical health. So, Dr Mantis is more interested in how PA helps athletes and non-athletes cope with issues such as depression, anxiety, and so on. 
 
Dr Mantis is also interested in finding optimal ways of motivating individuals to engage in desired health behaviours (e.g., PA). For instance, how we frame PA and health messages (e.g., emphasis on gains or losses, etc.), how we deliver such messages (e.g., using images, music, etc.), and how we customise messages to individuals’ characteristics (e.g., providing tailored feedback to individuals depending on their personality traits) can moderate the magnitude of their motivation.  
 
By identifying optimal ways of promoting health behaviours, we can help individuals adopt a healthier lifestyle (e.g., convincing sedentary people to be more active), follow recommended plans (e.g., helping injured athletes adhere to a rehab program), and so on. 
 
Finally, assessing psychological variables (e.g., personality) that can influence individual responses to behavior change interventions is another area of his research interests. For example, what tests of personality assess specific traits of individuals more accurately and how these traits relate to specific lifestyles? 
 
Dr Mantis is happy to supervise any projects that belong to the above research areas.

Research interests
My research interest lies in the general area of fluid mechanics. Although this covers a very wide range of research activity, my main expertise lies in high Reynolds number viscous flows. 
 
My initial investigations focused on the phenomena of boundary layer separation, both for steady-state and unsteady flows. I have also been interested in the stability of shear layers and boundary-layer flows, with particular emphasis on Tollmien-Schlichting, Gortler, and Kelvin-Helmholtz waves. This also led to an interest in sound generation. 
 
I am also interested in Stefan-like problems involving heat and mass transfer, such the impact  of freezing/boiling water droplets on aerofoils. This emanates from my PhD thesis (under Eric Watson) an investigation into the melting of ice-shapes.

SUMMARY 
 
Mike's focus is (i) flood basalt volcanism and its environmental effects; (ii) tropical weathering and lateritization processes. He uses a variety of analytical techniques - geochemistry (XRF, ICP and isotope studies), geochronology (Ar/Ar and Palaeomag). Fieldwork investigations are worldwide: in detail the evolution of the Deccan Traps large igneous province (LIP), and LIPs elsewhere (i.e., CRBP, BTIP, Iceland, Hawaii, Emeishan, Kalkarindji, Shatsky Rise). He is collaborating with Chinese scientists on projects documenting the development of the Himalaya and the associated floral evolution. His weathering studies have documented the fate of elements and behaviour of isotope systems during extreme alteration.


Postgraduate supervision
Mike is an established research supervisor (10 PhD students and c. 10 MSc, MRes students since 2000). These projects have resulted in >50 joint authored peer-reviewed publications. Enquiries and applications are welcomed in the following research areas: 
 
1) All areas of volcanology, in particular those related to the study of large igneous provinces, and associate environmental and/or biotic change. 
2) Geochemical and isotopic studies of deep weathering, in particular linkages between their development to environmental change  
 
 
Themes for past, present and future PhD studies include: 
 
Volcanology: 
Flood basalt volcanism 
Environmental effects of volcanic eruptions 
Interrogating the sedimentary record for LIP events 
Chemical memory of LIP eruptions 
Ancient Icelandic eruptions 
 
Deep weathering processes: 
Laterites and lateritization processes 
Behaviour of isotopic systems during deep weathering 
Evaluating weathering profiles as a paleoenvironmental proxy environment

494,Dr Colin Veach,https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/colin-veach,"

Research interests
Dr Veach's research investigates the articulation of power and dominion in medieval Britain and Ireland, placed in the context of Europe. His 2014 monograph Lordship in Four Realms was one of the first truly transnational studies of the medieval aristocracy, the social and cultural glue which bound the Britain and Ireland to continental Europe. Utilising the lens of ‘lordship’, it looked at how one family adapted its strategies of domination in four distinct polities: England, Ireland, Wales and Normandy.  
Recently, he has begun to approach transnational history and political culture from the perspective of empire, particularly through involvement in collaborative projects funded by the Leverhulme Trust (‘New Interpretations on the Angevin World’), and the AHRC (‘An Empire of Islands’).  
The two strands of ‘lordship’ and ‘empire’ are brought together and developed in his current Leverhulme-funded project ‘England’s First Colony: State-Building on the Irish Frontier, 1199-1265’

Research interests
Dr Sturge's research since 2001 has mainly focused on understanding how the receptor Endo180 contributes to the different stages of cancer. He is now using the latest technologies available to translate this knowledge into better survival rates for patients. His research in this area began by investigating the basic cell biology of Endo180 function as a pro-migratory receptor, followed by its function in more complex in vitro models of human cancer and most recently the translation of the findings towards diagnostic advances for breast, prostate, pancreatic and other cancer patients. In particular the discovery that Endo180 behaves as a supressor-to-promoter switch for the invasive behaviour of normal prostate epithelial cells set a precedent for this translational research. This includes development of the first diagnostic test for the accurate measurement of Endo180 levels in patient serum and the first multi-modal bio-imaging probe to monitor the pro-invasive switch in Endo180 in patients using near infra red (NIR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We are now conducting clinical trials to determine the value of Endo180 as a predictive cancer biomarker.

Research interests
My research investigates how animals perceive and respond to their environments, particularly in the context of social behaviour and environmental change. My group studies how animals interact with one another and their environment, and how the environment affects their behaviour. I am also interested in  how students learn, and in evaluating the effectiveness of learning and teaching strategies. 
 
Current research themes include: 
- Predator-prey interactions and the evolution of animal aggregation in response to predators, conspecifics and the distribution of resources. 
 
- The influence of experience and environmental change on behaviour, particularly in relation to the effects of increasing water turbidity on the behaviour of fishes. 
 
- The evolution of parental care, particularly the relationship between laterality (side biases in behaviour) and parental care in fish. 
 
- The effectiveness and value of feedback in student learning, the development of student autonomy, and the value of, and barriers to participation in fieldwork.


Postgraduate supervision
I welcome applications for PhD or MSc by Thesis study in all areas of my research, particularly those relating to the evolution of social and anti-predator behaviour, the impact of environmental change on the behaviour of fishes, and the way animals perceive their environments. I am able to supervise both theoretical and empirical projects (or projects that combine the two) and am willing to support applications from students wishing to access their own funding.

Research interests
Stewart Mottram is an interdisciplinary researcher specialising in seventeenth-century literature and culture in relation to topics surrounding literature and religion and literature and environment. Mottram draws on the research methods and approaches of History and Heritage Studies, and works in partnership with colleagues in Human Geography and Environmental Science.  
 
Literature and Religion 
Mottram’s latest book, ‘Ruin and Reformation in Spenser, Shakespeare, and Marvell' (Oxford University Press, 2019), is the first major study to explore the impact of reformation violence and ruin creation on English literature spanning the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It reads early modern English literature in light of English reformation history, and in dialogue with recent historiographical perspectives, exploring writerly responses to the religious violence of the long reformation in England and Wales across over a century of literature and history, from the establishment of the national church under Henry VIII (1534), to its disestablishment under Oliver Cromwell (1653). It focuses on representations of ruined churches, monasteries, and cathedrals in the works of a range of English Protestant writers, including Spenser, Shakespeare, Jonson, Herbert, Denham, and Marvell, reading literature alongside episodes in English reformation history: from the dissolution of the monasteries and the destruction of church icons and images, to the puritan reforms of the 1640s.  
 
Ruin and Reformation has been reviewed in 'The Review of English Studies', 'The Seventeenth Century', 'The Spenser Review', and 'Journal of British Studies'. Andrew Hui writes in 'The Spenser Review' that ""There are few literary critics today who have his deep reservoir of knowledge in the literary, political and religious history of the period. An empiricist at heart, his command of primary texts in manuscript and print is masterful and knowledge of secondary scholarship impressive."" 
 
Literature and Environment 
Mottram’s latest book project combines Literature, History, and Human Geography methodologies to explore the challenges and opportunities of living with water in the early modern Atlantic world, asking how cultural, social and technological responses to issues like flooding, water sanitation and supply, and water and wellbeing find representation in English and North American literature from this period.  
 
Mottram currently leads an AHRC/XR Stories Creative Industries Cluster project, ‘By the rising tide of Humber: Flooding Andrew Marvell’s Hull in VR’, an interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers in English, Geography, and the Energy and Environment Institute (EEI) at Hull together with industry partners, BetaJester Ltd. The project recreates in virtual reality (VR) a geographically and historically accurate model of 1640s Hull, which we use to test Hull's flood defence capability in the 1640s by subjecting the virtual town to an historical weather event - a documented storm surge and flood in 1646 - using flood modelling tools developed in the EEI. Through knowledge exchange, the project is driving developments in heritage and environmental applications of VR, while at the same time the VR product is enabling us to bring historical floods to life.

How Do People Handle Falsehood? 
 
A daily challenge for the mental system is to distinguish between true and false information. The rise of “fake news” seems to make it more and more difficult to distinguish between truth and falsehood. Mounting evidence demonstrates that false information alters existing knowledge even when people are warned about falsehood or surprisingly, even when they know the truth. Thus, it is crucial to investigate how the mental system deals with false information to explain and prevent errors in validation.

594,Professor Kathryn Haynes,https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/kathryn-haynes,"

Research interests
My research is on two inter-related themes around social responsibility: 
 
Firstly, I am interested in issues of gender and diversity in relation to the professions, particularly accounting.  i have published widely on issues relating to accounting and gender. This strand of research addresses identity and its relationship with gender; the body and embodiment within organisations; the juxtaposition of professional and personal identities; and the conduct of the professions and professional services firms. 
A second strand of research is on ‘Corporate Social Responsibility’, which links to my interests in social and environmental accounting; sustainability and responsibility; and issues of governance and accountability. 
I am currently working on linking these two areas through work on gender equality and sustainability. 
 
I am also interested in reflexive research methodologies, including narrative, autobiography, oral history and ethnography.

What problems for people do wild animals bring, and how can we best manage them? What problems for wildlife do people bring, and how best can we manage them? How can we reconcile competing objectives for wildlife across fragmented, multi-owner landscapes? What measurements of wildlife do we need to take in order to make evidence-based decisions about their management, how good are our estimates and how good do they need to be? These are the sorts of multi-disciplinary questions that keep me awake. If you would like to research solutions to peoples’ problems associated with wildlife (especially deer, but also other vertebrates) for the benefit of people and wildlife, I’d welcome a chat.

I am an ecologist and conservationist, with a strong interest in the responses of organisms (at individual, population and community levels) to anthropogenic changes in the biotic and abiotic components of their environment. I am keen to apply my skills in field-sampling species and interspecific interactions, and the complex analysis of large-scale and long-term datasets, to the study of biodiversity change on a rapidly changing planet. My previous research has ranged from analysis of community dynamics over periods of years or decades, to detailed single-species experimental and field studies. I am passionate about finding solutions that will allow species, and biodiversity as a whole, to thrive in the 21st century and beyond. Although much of my research to date has focussed on Lepidoptera, my interests are much broader, also including other insects, vertebrates and plants.

In particular, intercellular communication in between antigen presenting cells and T cells in humans shapes up the fate of T cells and this can affect the way we respond to pathogens and allergens, potentially making different individuals more or less susceptible to disease. Molecular pathways of intercellular communication between immune cells relevant in infection, critical inflammatory conditions and cancer are currently under investigation.

Development and validation of methods for analysis of drugs of abuse. Our results have demonstrated that hair analysis can be used in addition to urine/blood analyses as a valuable tool for long-term monitoring of drug (ab)use. Hair analysis benefits from non-invasiveness, negligible risk of infection and facile sample storage and collection, whilst reducing risks of tampering and cross contamination. Owing to the wide detection window, this approach may also offer an alternative approach for out-of-competition testing.

My principal research interests focus on fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling in cancer. The FGF receptor (FGFR) signalling pathway is implicated in a wide range of pathologies, most notably cancer, yet its efficient targeting is proving challenging to the pharmaceutical industry, partly because FGFR signalling is fundamental to so many normal biological processes. My previous research demonstrated that FGFR in breast cancer can get cleaved and translocate into the nucleus of the cells acting as a potential transcription factor that can alter metastatic cell behaviour. Previous studies have also demonstrated the presence of full length nuclear FGFR but never the cleaved form of the receptor. Targeting this novel aspect of FGFR signalling might represent a novel therapeutic approach in blocking cancer invasion. Research student supervision

The primary purpose of my research is to develop novel medical image analysis algorithms and software and to validate their effectiveness in a clinical environment. My  long-term research focuses on computer-aided detection (CAD) and Measurement (CAM) of lesions in medical images. CAD research aims at discovering the fundamental perception processes of human vision in the image-based diagnosis of lesions, and developing mathematical/computational models that describes them. I have developed and applied the CAD on lung cancer, colon cancer, breast, multiple sclerosis, neuropsychiatric disease, and dementia. My current research has concentrated on detecting, measuring and quantifying the vascular diseases (coronary artery disease, pulmonary embolism, brain aneurysm, abdominal and thoracic aneurysm and peripheral arteries disease) using CT angiography. In addition I hold a successful career in the development of highly novel medical intelligent software within the imaging field, responsible for leading the launch of many specialised products in to the global marketplace.

My early research looked at the multi-functionality of pharmaceutical excipients at micro and macro scale using physico-chemical techniques and at molecular level using gene-chips. My research interests expanded since I started my academic role at Kingston University London as I started to manage interdisciplinary projects. One theme of my research emphasise on the role of stimuli-responsive polymers in preparing smart delivery systems to confront common clinical conditions such diabetes and glaucoma. Nanomedicine is another area of my interest as I believe it will assist in personalizing medicine in the future. Chitosan and PLGA particles are engineered at nanoscale in our lab to manipulate drug release profiles according to patients' needs. To be a scientist in my teaching, my pedagogical research explores the role of community of practices (CoP) in enhancing learning experience amongst scholars. Social media and bookmarking tools are implemented into my teaching practice to enable students to assimilate and master new knowledge by sharing. I am also assessing students' perception and expectation of electronic feedback as a tool in identifying the gaps of students' learning and improve their performance by feeding forward.

My research group has a generally broad scope but all under the one health banner. We are involved in trying to understand how bacteria mutate in the face of different selective pressures as a result of antibiotic pressure. We are looking at the discovery of novel antibiotics from different environmental niches and we are looking at the development of novel and rapid diagnostics that can be used in both human and animal health to facilitate early identification of pathogens  and so appropriate and targeted treatment with anti-infectives. This approach also helps in the stewardship and protection of antibiotics. We are looking at antibiotic resistance spillover into wild raptor populations with the Sussex Peregrine Study Group. 
We are also working with the veterinary and farming communities to understand antimicrobial resistance using both traditional laboratory science as well as social science to understand the publics perception of antibiotic use and benefits. Research student supervision

My research work is focused on the study of the regulation of mucosal immune responses in the context of intestinal inflammation and the validation of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD).
I have a small research group currently study how immunomodulatory antibiotics regulate the function and phenotype of macrophages and other innate immune cells and how this relates to their anti-inflammatory effect. I have supervised and currently supervise PhD, MSc and undergraduate students on this area of research.
I have also participated as a co-investigator in a variety of research projects searching for pharmacological alternatives for the treatment of other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, with a particular interest in natural compounds (probiotics, prebiotics and medicinal plants).
Over the years, I have acquired a background in cellular immunology that complements my pharmacological training and contributes to my understanding of the pharmacology of immune-based therapies. I have expertise in the preclinical evaluation drugs in models of immunologically driven disease both in vivo (including genetically modified, tissue specific conditional knock outs and fluorescent reporter models), ex vivo (organ bath and explants) and in vitro (cell lines, co-cultures, immune cell culture). I have expertise in different histological, cellular and molecular techniques (multicolour flow cytometry and intracellular cytokine and transcription factor staining, ELISA, western blotting, microRNAs and mRNA RT-PCR).

DNA is continually exposed to exogenous and endogenous insults. Genomic integrity is maintained in the cell by a number of well-defined repair mechanisms including the double strand break (DSB) repair pathways of homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). However, defects in DNA repair can result in the improper repair of DNA damage and an increased propensity to cancer.I have previously showed that myeloid leukaemic cells and chromosomal instability syndromes demonstrated up-regulated and erroneous NHEJ repair activity as a result of constitutive DNA damage. We have realised that genetic defects in the pathways of DSB DNA repair and other DNA damage response pathways would render tumour cells sensitive to DNA repair inhibitors such as Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)inhibitors. Previously, trialled in breast cancer these agents have demonstrated beneficial therapeutic responses in more than 60 clinical trials. The future aims are to investigate and identify biomarkers in Leukaemia that would identify patients for PARP inhibitor therapy. Furthermore, could one further exploit DNA repair anomalies with other agents in Leukaemia for therapeutic intervention Research student supervision

REF 2021: My book ‘Sustainable Concrete Solutions' published in 2014 by Wiley has already developed beneficial impact to academia and industry and, will be an impact case study for the next REF (over 600 copies sold in over 40 countries around the world in the first 2 years).  Evidence of national impact is the review in the ICE Civil Engineering Proceedings (Volume 168 Issue CE2 May 2015) ""This book provides useful guidance to students, researchers, academics and practitioners of all construction disciplines. It is especially recommended to trainees preparing for their Institution of Civil Engineers professional review as it offers excellent background for that often-considered-problematic attribute of ‘sustainable development'. Evidence of international impact includes a review in the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) journal ‘Performance of Constructed Facilities' (Volume 29, Issue 2, March/April 2015, IF=0.841): ""This is a must-read book for designers, engineers, architects, researchers, planners, and students who advocate creating a sustainable built environment, because the author has keenly provided a very thorough, concise, engaging, and intriguing discussion within each of the five chapters. It covers all aspects of sustainability in concrete design, in a well-balanced fashion, adequately capturing the reader's attention to examine the advantages realised by embracing the concepts of sustainability. This book is an excellent resource""

Biogeochemical cycling of nutrients, trace elements (both essential and potentially toxic) and organic chemicals in managed and semi-natural ecosystems has been the focus of my work. Much of this has been driven by land use and environment change pressures and how they influence the biogeochemical cycling processes that ultimately determine their retention in soils and sediments, release to water or uptake by food plants. More recently we have been investigating sewage effluents impact on water quality in river systems, climate change mediated mobilisation and transportation of naturally occurring trace elements, land use change and soil carbon dynamics, and organic micro-contaminant dynamics in river systems.

My research focuses on the development and application of molecular and genomic tools to provide insights into the evolutionary and ecological processes acting on pathogens, parasites and invasive species in order to inform epidemiological studies, surveillance and control. I have a ""one health"" ethos to my research and the emphasis is primarily on zoonotic parasites affecting the health of wildlife, domestic animals and people in the tropics as well as invasions and emergence of parasites, disease vectors and economically important invertebrates throughout Europe. The main goal is to disentangle the underlying evolutionary events acting on such populations ranging from the detection of speciation events through to adaptive responses to host specific pressures such as antigenic variation, host compatibility, drug resistance and environmental tolerance, and the development of molecular tools to identify and monitor the spread of such organisms. My work is not only applied to organisms of direct importance to human and animal health but also those that could impact upon food security and biodiversity conservation. The work in my lab depends heavily on molecular techniques ranging from standard PCR for species identification to next generation sequencing and major downstream bioinformatics to identify genes that regulate parasitism and act as speciation barriers coupled with field work not only for collection but for monitoring infections and invasive organisms. Currently my team and I have five overlapping research areas
 
1.     The development and application of phylogenetically sound markers and the application of phylogeographical methodologies for the monitoring and surveillance of infectious diseases and invasive species
2.     Development and application of molecular barcoding techniques to identify emerging pathogens, disease vectors and invasive invertebrates of economic importance
3.     Using large molecular sequence data sets to model population evolutionary histories in order to infer historical ecological events as well as understanding transmission and spread of infection by estimate population divergence times, modelling demographic history, gene flow between localities (including hosts and environments) as well as adaptation and speciation events
4.     The use of genomic tools including next generation sequencing technologies, postgenomic data mining and protein functional modelling approaches to identify genes and molecular markers which can be used to monitor the spread of drug resistance, antigenic variation and virulence in pathogens
5.     Development of user friendly simple bioinformatic methodologies to understand parasite host interactions from the cellular to population level and for surveillance of invasive invertebrate species Research student supervision

Life would be much easier if organisations had a 3D map of the business landscape showing owners and entrepreneurs where best to go, how much they could benefit when they get there, as well as how much it would cost them along the way. Just as astronomers find out about our Universe by looking at lots of stars, and in different wavelengths, we are looking at lots of organisations and using metrics that are different to the ones that are normally visible. To do this we need to have a lot of information, this is called a ""Big Data"" approach. Unfortunately the metrics that are available in the UK, like company annual returns, don't tell us a lot. Indeed our previous research indicates that some important factors can be quite basic e.g. the number of employees each year within an organisation, and these figures are simply not collected centrally in the UK. Thus we have teamed up with international partners to obtain Big Data. Feeding this information into the computer model that we have developed in the UK, we can produce not only a user friendly and very practical 3D map of the ""Business Universe"", but also academically to reveal hidden insights into how humans cluster in organisations and indeed how clusters cluster. This approach is very relevant not only to consultants, owners, entrepreneurs and academics, but also to everyone who has a job. 
Our present research involves; (1) How do economic laws determine the shape of organisations (2) When organisations cluster in e.g. tech hubs or science parks, what is the best way of them to organise their structure and (3) create a computer model for business clusters feasibility, what metric(s) can be used to stipulate the distance between clusters and how do age, size and stage in the maturity cycle affect this distance?

I have a Track Record in Research in Inter-Disciplinary Areas that started many years ago during my postgraduate studies and my postdoctoral posts. I worked on an EU-AQUA joint collaboration between Kingston University, Queens Ireland, Barcelona water and University of Manchester on liquid fingerprints. EPSRC joint collaboration between Kingston University & University of North London on thermoplastic conducting polyaniline-rubber blends & composites. MRC joint collaboration between The Royal London Hospital Medical College and Queen Mary University, London, on Biophysics in relation to Dentistry and Biomaterials. My DPhil was on EU joint collaboration between Imperial College London and Universite Claude Bernard, Lyon, France on Nano- Ceramics from Molten Salts for Medical applications. Since became permanent in 2014, I focused my research on Diverse Middle Eastern projects, which have attracted many interests. To date, I have secured 9 Summer Internships Research projects that are sponsored by Kingston University for the sum of £10,800. These projects have benefited undergraduates with training on many essential soft and hard skills such as academic writing skills, analytical and chemical analysis, project management, critical thinking, IT skills, using spectroscopic and microscopy techniques to enrich them with the skills required for the work place. Projects that I managed include anti-oxidants in date palm as anti-cancer, biodegradable polymers blends for bone scaffold and other day to day projects; investigation of micro-plastic particles in food and drink, eating olive oil to lower cholesterol, nanotechnology in toothpaste and risk assessments and awareness of harmful chemicals in cheap cosmetics. My research interests are advertised on FindAPhD website with the recent attracted many self-funded PhD applicants on nutraceuticals to treat neoplastic and infectious diseases. I am a reviewer on several peer-reviewed research articles for Elsevier-3 book proposals, John Wiley & Sons on transcript of French Molten salts chemistry book, Smithers-Rapa and SAGE-Journal of Polymers and Polymer Composites. Recently, I have applied for First Grant Award for the value of 10,000 to spend on research projects that are relevant to REF with possible collaboration from across the EU, the US, WHO, and NHS. I was Internal Examiner to 2 MPhil-PhD transfers (March & June 2019) on removal of traces concentrations of pharmaceuticals in water supplies in Lebanon, and polymeric scaffolds for retinal tissue regeneration. I was internal examiner for PhD viva (April 2017) on the degradation of polypropylene and novel blend formulations and the release of hazardous chemicals. I have supervised 17 Masters, 30 undergraduates, 7 summer interns, co-supervised postdoctoral research fellow on computational of light-weight bone material (2018), and 3 PhDs students on thermoplastic and conducting polymer blends and composites projects.

Technology Enabled Care
My research expertise includes the use of telehealth/mobile health to promote personalised management of long term conditions. This work has led to the design and development of virtual support systems to support cancer patients. The design and development were guided by in depth needs assessment conducted via a mixed method approach of quantitative and qualitative research tools.My research expertise revolves around studying healthcare/organisational needs for the implementation of innovation and the evaluation of such interventions.
Cancer care
Improving cancer care is at the heart of my research and scholarly endeavours. This includes the study of ambulatory chemotherapy nationally and internationally evaluating the performance and pharmacoeconomics of elastomeric pumps, conducting stability indicating assay methods (HPLC, LCMS and NMR analysis) to streamline the preparation and delivery of chemotherapeutic agents and designing smart systems to improve ambulatory chemotherapy. 
In order to support academic research in oncology and to maintain the safety of researchers and staff in University settings. I have led the development of the guidance for the safe handling of cytotoxics in academic research labs.
Interprofessional Education

I lead research in pattern recognition and machine learning applied to computer vision and bioinformatics, supported by multidisciplinary and international collaborations. 
In computer vision, I focus on designing machine learning approach to recognise human actions from video data. In particular, I have pioneered with international collaborators usage of common sense reasoning to enhance computer vision-based action recognition. This was featured in 'Communications of the ACM' in December 2014. Currently, I develop a new genomics-inspired paradigm for computer vision, which has led to a Best paper prize award at the EvoStar conference. 
In bioinformatics, my research activities span across different aspects including protein interaction and structure prediction. This includes usage of formal grammars for modelling the 3D structure of proteins. More recently, I have led the development of novel approaches for the 3D structure prediction of both single chain and complexed proteins. This research has been applied on proteins involved in medical conditions through collaborations with life scientists. Qualifications and expertise

My research has centred around Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL). Past work has included contributions to a number of HEA and JISC-funded projects e.g. Uniqurate (see http://uniqurate.kingston.ac.uk and https://blogs.kingston.ac.uk/ltrg), FETLAR, QTIDI and QTI-PET. These projects involved the development of tools to support and the promotion of the QTI e-assessment standard.
My current work centres around TEL and the pedagogy of introductory programming. The main artefact of this work is NoobLab (see www.nooblab.com), an innovative online learning environment designed to make learning programming engaging and accessible. Intelligent feedback is provided and gamification is used as a persuasive technique to increase motivation. The metrics gathered by the environment can also be used to inform pedagogy and interventions, encourage metacognition among students and detect plagiarism. The outcomes of this work are used in undergraduate programming teaching at Kingston and represent a key differentiator for this institution.

Transcending scientific boundaries has been a hallmark of my research career  with multiple national and international inter-disciplinary  collaborations. My research experience ranges from the synthesis of  organic, inorganic, hybrid, nano and porous materials, to protein  chemistry, and microbiology. My current research draws inspiration from  my PhD and postdoctoral experiences; the highlights of which were the  development of a greener approach to solar energy harvesting via a  protein incorporated ""Hybrid Soft Solar Cell""; optimization of  mesoporous titanosilicates as highly active epoxidation catalysts; and  development of robust, responsive, biocompatible magnetic hydrogels for  drug delivery.
At present, I am pursuing two major research interests under the  unifying theme of ""advanced functional nanomaterials for sustainable  applications"": 1) Development of advanced composite materials for water  purification, light harvesting and photo/chemo catalysis, 2) Development  of composite hydrogels for applications in wound care and customizable  drug delivery.

Teach and inspire the next generation of space propulsion engineers and researchers for the UK space industry.
Explore propulsion and launcher technologies that lower the cost per mass of getting technology into space.
Exploring propulsion and power technologies that will enable human exploration of the solar system with the specific aim of aiding the exploration of Jupiter and its moons.

My research interests are varied but mainly fall within the broad umbrellas of soft condensed matter and biological physics. Key research areas include:

Engineering principles in membrane biophysics 
Designer lipids and mesoscale materials for future drug delivery 
Tools and technologies for health-related applications

Historically, these mostly stem from my final year undergraduate research project, which was on the Marangoni effect of dilute surfactant solutions with Professor Colin Bain (now based at Durham University). This in turn then led to a PhD funded by Unilever on the lyotropic phase behaviour of charged amphiphiles (in essence, surfactants comprising fabric softeners) in the Membrane Biophysics group at Imperial College. Post-doctoral research in a range of closely related areas such as drug-lipid membrane interactions consolidated my interests in biophysics.

My research largely focuses on the pathogenic Neisseria species of bacteria: Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis. N. gonorrhoeae causes the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhoea, as well as ophthalmia neonatorum, an infection of the eyes of newborns that can lead to blindness. N. meningitidis causes meningitis and septicaemia, life threatening conditions.
Research in my lab has been addressing the problem of antibiotic resistance in gonorrhoea infections. With the support of the Sparks charity (https://www.sparks.org.uk/), we have developed a promising new alternative to antibiotics that can be used to treat ophthalmia neonatorum, featured in Wired (https://www.wired.co.uk/article/fight-against-super-gonorrhoea).
Genomics research in my lab has provided novel insights into the genetic make-up of these bacterial pathogens. We are also investigating related non-pathogenic species, which provide alternative treatment options not yet explored. My genomics research led to my W H Pierce Prize from the Society for Applied Microbiology (https://sfam.org.uk/knowledge/awards-and-prizes/wh-pierce-prize.html).
My genomics and antimicrobial research has resulted in numerous peer-reviewed research publications and conference presentations (listed below) selected for REF2014 and REF2021, as well as application for UK (GB1701450.7) and EU (18154222.6-1112) patents. I am the third generation in my family to hold a patent. My father is named on a patent from his work at Yale University Hospital in respiratory therapy and his father holds a patent designed from his experiences with delivering milk for a dairy in New Haven, Connecticut.
I serve on the Editorial Boards for Microorganisms and Microbial Genomics. I have reviewed many manuscripts for over 25 quality journals in my field and been reviewer for several UKRI bodies and other national and international agencies.
I have successfully supervised 7 PhD students who have completed their studies, 2 as primary supervisor, as well as having supervised 2 MSc by Research students, one as primary supervisor.

Currently we are investigating whether other simple technology (such as personal response or voting systems) can be employed effectively with technical subjects such as mathematics to enhance student engagement and consequently student learning.

My research interests are very much focussed on diet and supplements for exercise and health.   Recent Phd projects include the effects of Nitrate, High Flavanol Dark Chocolate and also different algae such as Spirulina and Chlorella and analysing their effects on oxygen consumption and performance. I am also leading projects on Ketogenic diets (High Fat-Low Carbohydrate) while supplementing with glucose and how this might benefit exercise and performance.  The whole high fat or low fat diet argument is fascinating to me and I am dedicated to unravelling some of the mysteries and myths related to our dietary understanding of what it is to be a healthy eater.    Areas of specialism

After obtaining my PhD in organic/materials chemistry, titled ""The Synthesis and Properties of Phenyl-Cored Thiophene Dendrimers"" I quickly gained the position of Senior Chemist in a biotechnology company. Where I utilised my undergraduate biological experience and research expertise in the synthesis of organic/macromolecule compounds to aid in the development of bioconjugates for antibody drug conjugates (ADC), anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and in-vitro diagnostics, e.g. lateral flow assay development, for a wide range of pharmaceutical and bio-pharmaceutical research.

I have built a strong interest in analytical techniques used in materials and Forensic research. I have supervised both undergraduate and postgraduate students within this interdisciplinary research area, including applying analytical techniques to blood pattern analysis, plasticisers in polymers, aging and degradation studies, sterilisation studies and biomaterial applications.  I was awarded a knowledge transfer partnership grant (£130,000) to collaborate with a world leading intraocular lens manufacturer to investigate the development of new ophthalmic materials.  This area of research has gained interest with international university collaborations and subsequent grants are currently being prepared with Erasmus partners. 
More recently I have been awarded an RSC award to supervise analytical based research with undergraduate students in collaboration with a contact lens manufacturer.  Equally I have gained funding from the Royal Society Partnership grant to promote the application of ""chemistry"" in Forensic science.      Research student supervision

Three threads have continued throughout my research career surviving evolution and change in the specific projects in which I have been actively engaged. These threads relate to differentiation between rural and urban environments, population dynamics and migration and interaction between human and physical processes. Current projects concern

connecting the micro-scale demography of areas of London and Middlesex over a period of 100 years (1901-11 and 2001-11) for which I was awarded a British Academy Senior Research Fellowship
investigating and modelling the impact of war-time emergency measures on the agriculture and landscape of the South Downs
extending work on older people's adjustment to urban regeneration and renewal

Human schistosomiasis, caused by blood fluke parasites such as Schistosoma mansoni, is a neglected tropical disease that infects over 260 million people across 76 countries. Research within the Walker Laboratory aims to better understand the basic biology of these parasites and how they interact with their mammalian and snail hosts. By employing techniques such as protein kinase assay, confocal laser scanning microscopy/immunohistochemistry, RNA interference, and phenotype assays the research seeks to define the fundamental mechanisms by which cellular proteins regulate schistosome form and function. The research could result in the identification of candidate proteins for the development of novel anti-schistosome drugs. Key areas include:

Functional mapping of protein kinase signalling in Schistosoma mansoni
Understanding schistosome function through integration of cellular networks 
Signalling through lipid rafts in Schistosoma mansoni
Male-female schistosome interactions 
Phosphoproteomics of schistosomes
Immunity of Biomphalaria glabrata, intermediate host to Schistosoma mansoni

My research into the vegetation history of the British Isles has focused on southern England, an area little studied because of the perceived absence of deposits suitable for pollen analysis. I have investigated early and mid-Holocene vegetation composition and the development of habitats that are of importance for conservation (chalk grassland, lowland heathland and wood pasture).
Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions from the West Africa Sahel have been undertaken as part of the NERC funded TIGGER project. In addition to contributions to project publications dealing with climatic variability, articles relating specifically to vegetation history have been produced.
Holocene land-ocean interactions, particularly the development of coastal wetlands, have been a research focus for many years. Collaborations include English Heritage funded work on the evolution of the Rye/Dungeness barrier system with workers from Durham and Liverpool Universities and the interpretation of pollen assemblages from the Thames estuary.
